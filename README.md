# Assignment-1-DSA-Virtual-machine-hcmut
The whole assignment solution will be accessible after finishing the subject (since assignment 2 and 3 are relevant to assignment 1).

Currently, you will only see a ```main.cpp``` file. This is a modified file from the original one, which helps you yield your solutions and check your testcases more easily than manually updating every testcase file.

To use ```main.cpp```, you only change the body of the ```testSuite``` function as guided by the comments in the file. Before testing, remember to create 2 folders ```testcase``` and ```solution``` at your working directory. Your testcases are written into txt file in the ```testcase``` folder and your solutions yielded by your VM codes are written into txt file in the ```solution``` folder.
