# Assignment-1-DSA-Virtual-machine-hcmut
This is a solution to the assignment 1 of DSA course, where you would build a Virtual Machine using C++. The detail of the VM is specified in the ```.pdf``` file.

To use ```main.cpp```, you only change the body of the ```testSuite``` function as guided by the comments in the file. Before testing, remember to create 2 folders ```testcase``` and ```solution``` at your working directory. Your testcases are written into txt file in the ```testcase``` folder and your solutions yielded by your VM codes are written into txt file in the ```solution``` folder.
